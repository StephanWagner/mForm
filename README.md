Notice
------
I'm sorry to inform you, that as of January 2014, I'm abandoning the mBox and mForm projects.
I just can't see any future in Mootools at the moment, so I am currently working on jBox and jForm, which are clones from mBox and mForm written in jQuery.


mForm

Some of mForm's features:

* Simple form-validation
* Submitting with ajax made more comfortable
* Simple CAPTCHA solution
* Cross-browser placeholders

How to use
----------

Styling your form elements is straight forward with CSS, just edit /assets/mForm.css to your liking.

All options for your form and form elements are set in mForm.Core.js.
