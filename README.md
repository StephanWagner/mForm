I'm sorry to inform you, that as of January 2014, I've abandoned the mBox and mForm projects.


mForm
-----

mForm helps you to make your forms and form elements nicer, better and more awesome.

Some of mForm's features:

* Simple form-validation
* Submitting with ajax made more comfortable
* Simple CAPTCHA solution
* Cross-browser placeholders
* Fully styleable select fields


How to use
----------

Styling your form elements is straight forward with CSS, just edit /assets/mForm.css to your liking.

All options for your form and form elements are set in mForm.Core.js.
